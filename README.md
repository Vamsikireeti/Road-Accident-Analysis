# Road-Accident-Analysis
A Road Accident Analysis using Power BI can provide insights into the patterns and factors contributing to traffic accidents. Power BI's data visualization and interactive features allow you to explore the data, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve road safety. Hereâ€™s an overview of how you might approach this analysis:

Key Objectives:
# Analyze Accident Trends:
Identify patterns in road accidents over time (e.g., daily, monthly, annually).
Spot any seasonal variations or time-of-day trends.

# Identify High-Risk Locations:
Map accident hotspots to determine areas with the most frequent or severe accidents.
Look into road conditions, lighting, and other environmental factors in these areas.

#Understand Causes of Accidents:
Explore the primary causes of accidents (e.g., speeding, weather conditions, driver behavior, distractions).
Use visuals to drill down into specific factors.

# Demographics and Driver Behavior:
Analyze accidents by driver demographics (age, gender) to identify any correlations.
Study factors like seatbelt use, speeding, or DUI (driving under the influence) involvement.

# Severity of Accidents:
Break down accident severity (e.g., minor injuries, major injuries, fatalities).
Compare how accident causes or locations correlate with severity levels.

# Vehicle and Environmental Conditions:
Examine how factors like vehicle type (car, truck, motorcycle) and road conditions (wet, dry, icy) influence accidents.
